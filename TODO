*** ToDos ***

- search for todo's


*** Bugs ***

- clone needs to preserve object identity

- new engine/ changes in proxy API

- To many conflicts in test case. Is this a bug?


*** Minor Features *** 

- recursive rollback, 

- rebase, (different semantics to revert) reset only the snapshot values
  (requires that the clone is a target --> revert/rebase do the same)

- Better pre-state snapshot mode

- Transaction Handling

- Clear Effects/Tragets when revert

- If a sandbox commits, read effects have to be removed or considered when calculating conflicts.

- Conflicts may compare values
(maybe introduce a raw mode, that compares the values recursively -- based on effects)?

- Make sbx.conflicts(sbx2); -- to -- sbx.conflictsWith(sbx2);

- Add an event observer, for example ACP/TratJS to protext ressources

- Merge from TreatJS/ degubber/ out
